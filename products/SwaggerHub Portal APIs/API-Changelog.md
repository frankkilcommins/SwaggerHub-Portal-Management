## v0.1.0-beta

Initial launch of the SwaggerHub Portal API.

> ðŸš§This version is classified as being in **beta** and is subject to _breaking changes_ over the coming period. That being said, we do encourage consumption and experimentation of the API.

The API provides the ability to access, manage, and update the following resources:
| Resource | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Portals | A collection representing portal instances and allowing management on portal instances settings. The portal settings control the branding, name, domain url, and availability of a portal. These settings are split into three levels: `general`, `branding`, and `landingPage`. |
| Products | A collection of metadata (a.k.a. **product settings**), API reference documents (e.g., an OpenAPI document), and Markdown documents which are bundled and presented to a consumer as a product. |
| Documents | A resource for storing document content (specifically for Markdown files). |
| Sections | A section is a resource used to hold API references as well as API document references and organize them into tables of contents. |

Great to be live!
