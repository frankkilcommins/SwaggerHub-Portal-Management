# SwaggerHub-Portal-Management

This ReadMe demonstrates how to automate the deployment of products and product content to be published to aSwaggerHub portal instance üöÄ

This bootstrapped repository is setup with 3 sample products which will be deployed and optionally auto-published.
 - A sample "_Adopt a Pet_" product exists in this [folder](./products/Adopt%20a%20Pet/)
 - A sample "_SwaggerHub Portal APIs_" product exists in this [folder](./products/SwaggerHub%20Portal%20APIs/)
 - A sample "_Zephyr Squad APIs_" product exists in this [folder](./products/Zephyr%20Squad%20APIs/)

 Each product has varying number of pages, images, content nesting etc.

## Conventions

The automation works by uploading content structured in accordance with the following conventions.

### Folder / File Structure Conventions

The following product structure must be adhered to allow for the automation to process the products and content:

- products _folder_- a folder containing all products to be uploaded and published. Each product _sub-folder_ name will be used as the `product name` created/modified within the portal
  - product One _folder_ - contains all data relevant to "Product One"
    - *.md _files_ - contains the markdown documents to be published within "Product One". The file name is used as the table-of-contents entry name.
    - images _folder_ - a folder to house the product logo and _embedded_ sub-folder
      - *.png / *.jpeg - a root level image to be used as the product logo (needs to be reference from the `manifest.json`)
      - embedded _folder_ - a folder to storing all images to be embedded within the product markdown pages. See [Image Embedding Conventions](#image-embedding-convention) for more info on how to reference.
    - manifest.json - stores product metadata (like description, slug, logo url, visibility, etc.) and content metadata (like table of contents order, page nesting, etc.)
  - product Two ...
  - product N ...

### Image Embedding Convention

The automation process will first publish all product images and then use the published metadata to replace image link placeholders within the markdown content.

The convention is as follows:

`![image-filename-including-file-extension](relative path to image in the ./images/embedded folder)`

An example of how an image should be referenced in the markdown is as follows:

```markdown
![Sample-Portal-Landing-With-Product.png](./images/embedded/Sample-Portal-Landing-With-Product.png)
```

### OpenAPI References in Markdown Convention

The OpenAPI references are predictable based on your known SwaggerHub Portal sub-domain.

The convention for embedding a link to a specific OpenAPI operation within a markdown page is as follows:

`[link text of your choice](https://<YOUR-SWAGGERHUB-SUBDOMAIN>.portal.swaggerhub.com/swaggerhub-portal/default/<API-SLUG>#/<OPENAPI-TAG-CONTAINING-OPERATIONAL-IF-APPLICABLE>/<OPENAPI-OPERATION-ID>)`.

So you will replace the following parameters which are all known up front:
- `YOUR-SWAGGERHUB-SUBDOMAIN` - the sub-domain used by your portal instance
- `API-SLUG` - the slug defined for your API content (defined in the relevant manifest.json)
- `OPENAPI-TAG-CONTAINING-OPERATIONAL-IF-APPLICABLE` - if your operation is nested under a tag then you should define the link with the appropriate tag name
- `OPENAPI-OPERATION-ID` - the `operationId` of the path item object within the API you want to reference from the markdown

An example of how an operation reference should be embedded in the markdown is as follows:

```markdown
Check out the products operation at [`/products`](https://frankkilcommins.portal.swaggerhub.com/swaggerhub-portal/default/swaggerhub-portal-api#/Products/createProduct).
```

### Table of Contents Conventions

The table of contents is completely driven by the `manifest.json` file contained within each Product folder.

A sample manifest is as follows:

```json
{
    "productMetadata": {
        "description": "This product gives the ability to programmatically embedded a Pet adoption workflow into your application üê∂",
        "slug": "pet-adoptions",
        "public": true,
        "hidden": false,
        "logo": "images/AdoptionsAPI.png",
        "logoDark": "",
        "autoPublish": true,
        "validateAPIs": true
    },
    "contentMetadata": [
        {
            "order": 0,
            "parent": "",
            "name": "Getting Started with Pet Adoptions",
            "slug": "getting-started-with-pet-adoptions",
            "type": "markdown",
            "contentUrl": "Getting-Started-With-Pet-Adoptions.md"
        },
        {
            "order": 1,
            "parent": "getting-started-with-pet-adoptions",
            "name": "Client Code (C#)",
            "slug": "client-code-csharp",
            "type": "markdown",
            "contentUrl": "Client-Code-Csharp.md"
        },
        {
            "order": 2,
            "parent": "getting-started-with-pet-adoptions",
            "name": "Client Code (Typescript)",
            "slug": "client-code-typescript",
            "type": "markdown",
            "contentUrl": "Client-Code-Typescript.md"
        },
        {
            "order": 5,
            "parent": "",
            "name": "Pets API",
            "type": "apiUrl",
            "slug": "pets-api",
            "contentUrl": "https://api.swaggerhub.com/apis/frank-kilcommins/Pets/1.0.0/swagger.json"
        },
        {
            "order": 6,
            "parent": "",
            "name": "Adoptions API",
            "type": "apiUrl",
            "slug": "adoptions-api",
            "contentUrl": "https://api.swaggerhub.com/apis/frank-kilcommins/Adoptions/1.0.0/swagger.json"
        }
    ]
}
```

The `productMetadata` defines the following properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| description | This property provides a description of the product. It explains what the product does and its purpose. |
| slug | The slug is a unique identifier for the product. It is used in the URL and helps to identify the product in the portal. |
| public | This property determines whether the product is publicly accessible or not. If set to true, the product can be accessed by anyone. If set to false, only authorized users can access the product. |
| hidden | The hidden property determines whether the product is visible in the portal or not. If set to true, the product will be hidden from the portal. If set to false, the product will be visible. |
| logo | The logo property specifies the path to the product logo image file. It is used to display the logo in the portal. |
| logoDark | The logoDark property specifies the path to an alternative version of the product logo image file. It is used when a dark version of the logo is needed. |
| autoPublish | This property determines whether the product should be automatically published after deployment or not. If set to true, the product will be published automatically. If set to false, the product will not be published automatically. |
| validateAPIs | This property determines whether API standardization rules should be ran against the API to determine conformance with organizational rules. |


The `contentMetadata` defines the following properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| order | The order in which the content should appear in the table of contents. |
| parent | The slug of the parent content, if the current item is to be nested under a parent item. |
| name | The name of the content page. |
| slug | The slug is a unique identifier for the content. It is used in the URL and helps to identify the content in the portal. |
| type | The type of the content. It can be either "markdown" or "apiUrl". |
| contentUrl | The URL or file path of the content. For markdown content, it is the path to the markdown file. For API content, it is the URL of the Swagger/OpenAPI specification as published in SwaggerHub |


## GitHub Action

This repo comes with a simple boilerplate action that can be trigger manually or upon merge into the `main` branch.

The action requires the following **repository secrets** to be configured:
- `SWAGGERHUB-API-KEY` - an API key associated to a user with the appropriate permission to be able to publish Portal content. See [Portal User Management](https://support.smartbear.com/swaggerhub-portal/docs/en/user-management.html) for more info.

The action requires the following **repository environment** to be configured:
- `Production` - the default environment. Feel free to configure additional environment and adjust the action as required if applicable for your use case.

The action requires the following **repository environment variables** to be configured:
- `SWAGGERHUB_PORTAL_SUBDOMAIN` - the sub-domain used by your portal
- `SWAGGERHUB_ORG_NAME` - the SwaggerHub organization housing the APIs and standardization rules
